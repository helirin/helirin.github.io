        <h1>User interface plan for mobile app</h1>
        
        <p>This plan was created during the Visual Elements of UI course. 
         I designed the logo, buttons, colors and layout for the user interface, but the images are from Pixabay.</p>
        <h2>What, to whom, and where</h2>
        <p>The app is for tourists who need to find vegetarian food in a foreign city. 
        Vegetarians can find good places to eat just by entering their location into the app that is on a mobile phone.</p>
