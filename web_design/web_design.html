        <h1>Web design project</h1>
        <p>I implemented this project during two web design courses.The courses were Web Design: Strategy and Information Architecture and 
            Web Design: Wireframes and Prototypes.
        The premise of the project was that an entrepreneur wants to open a new location that delivers food to customers living nearby. 
        The task was to design the restaurant's website.The centerpiece of this website will be an online food customization and ordering system.
        The project consisted of seven stages: Project Ideas, Strategy, Outline of Scope, Sitemap, Wireframes, Mockups and Prototype</p>
        <p>The idea of my restaurant was to deliver cakes and savory pies to small parties and business meetings at a reasonable price. 
            The target group was busy working people, for example family mothers. 
            The user needs and the client needs as well as the target group are part of the strategy. 
            The outline of scope is a list of content requirements and functional requirements</p>
